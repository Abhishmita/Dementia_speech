# Classification of Audio as Dementia or not.
This project aims to construct a model that can classify the audio into two categories.


# Dataset
The dataset is taken from the Dementia Bank: https://dementia.talkbank.org/access/. As this data is confidential, one can access data by contacting them.

# Model
The data is classified using Resnet18.

# Libraries.
The whole project is constructed using Fastai v1 libraries.

# Future work.
We are looking for a deployment model. Once the model is deployed successfully, then the audio can be classified on a real-time base.
